after gcloud app deploy if deos not work used this command 

Excellent — thank you for pasting this.
I know **exactly what’s happening here** — let’s untangle this cleanly.

---

## 🔍 **Why this error happens:**

The error:

```
service account example-project-461804@appspot.gserviceaccount.com does not have access to the bucket staging.example-project-461804.appspot.com
```

means:

* The **default App Engine service account doesn’t have permission to access the Cloud Storage bucket** used for staging your deployment files before deploying to App Engine.

This is a **common issue in new GCP projects or if permissions were tweaked**.

---

## ✅ Clean 3-Step Fix:

---

### 📌 1️⃣ Grant required permissions to the App Engine service account

Run this command in Cloud Shell:

[

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding example-project-461804 \
  --member="serviceAccount:example-project-461804@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/storage.admin"

]

✅ This grants your App Engine service account permission to access staging buckets during deployments.

---

### 📌 2️⃣ Clean up any previous failed builds (optional but good practice)
[

gcloud builds list

]
If you see stuck or failed builds, you can cancel or just ignore — new deploys will supersede them.

---

### 📌 3️⃣ Try deploying again

Now re-run:

gcloud app deploy



IMP= used only step three commands which was in between [ ]
